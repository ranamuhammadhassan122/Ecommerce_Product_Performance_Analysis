# 📊 E-commerce Product Performance Analysis

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to identify the key factors influencing product performance metrics, such as **Days to Deliver** and **Stock Availability**.

## 📁 File Included

- `ecommerce_product_performance.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, visualizations, correlation analysis, and interpretation.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze what factors affect **Days to Deliver**.
- Identify features that impact **Stock Availability**.
- Visualize relationships among `Product_Price`, `Discount_Rate`, `Product_Rating`, `Number_of_Reviews`, and delivery time.
- Interpret correlation coefficients to understand feature relationships.

## 📈 Techniques & Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Correlation analysis for feature insights

## 📌 Key Insights

- Most features showed **weak correlation** with `Stock_Availability` (correlation values below 0.23).
- Scatter plots revealed that `Days_to_Deliver` often had **limited variation**, causing horizontal lines in plots.
- Box plots could offer better understanding for categorical delivery day distributions.
